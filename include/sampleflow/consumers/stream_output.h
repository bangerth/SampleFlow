     * A Consumer class that outputs each sample it receives to a
     * `std::ostream` object. This can be used to write all samples into
     * a file, for example.
     *
     *
     * ### Threading model ###
     *
     * The implementation of this class is thread-safe, i.e., its
     * consume() member function can be called concurrently and from multiple
     * threads.
     *
     *
     * @tparam InputType The C++ type used for the samples $x_k$. In
     *   order to output it through an object of type `std::ostream`,
     *   it must be possible to write
     *   @code
     *      stream << sample;
     *   @endcode
     *   where `sample` is of type `InputType`. Alternatively, if one can
     *   call `sample.size()` and `sample[i]` with an integer index `i`,
     *   then this class only requires that one can write
     *   @code
     *      stream << sample[i];
     *   @endcode
     *   and writes all elements of the sample separated by spaces.
     *   In particular, this allows using this class for `InputType`
     *   equal to `std::vector<T>` and `std::valarray<T>`.
