    /**
     * A Consumer class that executes an action every time a sample comes
     * in, passing the sample to the action. The action is simply a function
     * object that takes the sample and the corresponding auxiliary data
     * as its only arguments; whatever the action object returns is discarded.
     *
     * A typical way to use this class is as follows:
     * @code
     *   using SampleType = ...;
     *   Producers::SomeProducerClass<SampleType> producer(...);
     *
     *   const auto action_function =
     *     [](SampleType sample,
     *        AuxiliaryData aux_data) {  std::cout << sample << std::endl;  };
     *   Consumers::Action<SampleType> action (action_function);
     *   action.connect_to_producer (producer);
     * @endcode
     * In this scenario, every sample that the `producer` generates is sent to
     * the Action object that then calls the lambda function `action_function`
     * on it, which in turn outputs the sample to the screen. (The
     * `action_function` in this example simply ignores the `aux_data` argument
     * it receives.
     *
     * A slightly more interesting example would be the following:
     * @code
     *   using SampleType = ...;
     *   Producers::SomeProducerClass<SampleType> producer(...);
     *
     *   std::ofstream output_file ("samples.txt");
     *   const auto action_function =
     *     [&output_file](SampleType sample,
     *                    AuxiliaryData aux_data)
     *     { output_file << sample << std::endl; };
     *   Consumers::Action<SampleType> action (action_function);
     *   action.connect_to_producer (producer);
     * @endcode
     * Here, the sample is output to a file stream that writes into a file
     * named `samples.txt`. The lambda function "captures" the `output_file`
     * variable declared in the previous line.
     *
     *
     * ### Differences to other consumers ###
     *
     * In some sense, all classes derived from Consumer perform some kind of
     * action when they receive a sample. The difference is that almost all
     * of these classes update some state variables. For example, the
     * Consumers::MeanValue class takes a sample and uses it to update
     * its current estimate of the mean of all samples. On the other hand,
     * the action object passed to the current class can not update any
     * internal state because it is, in essence, a global function -- it
     * has no state other than some global variable. In the first example
     * above, the only state it updates is the global `std::cout` variable,
     * in the second one the `output_file` variable declared in the scope
     * in which the Action object is declared.
     *
     * As a consequence of these considerations, the Action class is
     * typically used as a "trigger": Do something concrete every time
     * a sample comes in, but do this in a stateless way. (If one considers
     * writing to a file or to screen as "stateless" -- it is, from a
     * pragmatic perspective, not an "update" operation on a variable whose
     * state is of relevance at a later time in the program.)
     *
     * This class is often used together with the Filters::TakeEveryNth class
     * to execute some action every $n$th sample.
     *
     *
     * ### Threading model ###
     *
     * The implementation of this class is thread-safe, i.e., its
     * consume() member function can be called concurrently and from multiple
     * threads. A constructor argument determines whether the action is executed
     * only once at any given time, or whether it can be executed concurrently.
     *
     *
     * @tparam InputType The C++ type used for the samples $x_k$.

         * Constructor. Take the action (a function object) as argument.

         * The second argument determines whether the action needs to be
         * protected by a mutex or whether the action can be executed multiple
         * times concurrently if there are several samples coming in in short
         * succession on different threads.
         *
         * The third argument (defaulted to ParallelMode::synchronous) indicates
         * whether incoming samples should be processed immediately, on the current
         * thread, or can be deferred to (possibly out of order) processing on
         * a separate thread. See ParallelMode for more information. Whether this
         * is possible or not depends on what the `action` function does.
