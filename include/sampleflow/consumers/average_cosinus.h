     * This is a Consumer class that implements computing the running average cosine of
     * angles between vectors value. This calculation, similarly to autocovariance, compares samples, that are
     * apart by specific index. In this sense, we get function where domain is bounded unsigned int and for
     * each value we calculate cosine average.
     * Let's say unsigned int is equal to l and n_samples=n and n is bigger than l. Then the formula can be written as:
     * $\hat{cos(\theta_n)(l)}=\frac{1}{n-l}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{(x_{t+l}^T\bar{x})(\|x_{t}\| \; \|\bar{x}\|)}$.
     *
     * This code for every new sample updates $\hat{cos(\theta_n)(l)}, l=1,2,3,\ldots,L$. The value of
     * $L$ is provided to the constructor of this class.
     *
     * Notice, that for each new sample $x_n$, we need to take a sample, that was $l$ earlier than new sample ($x_{n-l}$).
     * Working this way, the updating algorithm becomes very similar to one used in the MeanValue class.
     *
     * Every time, for updating we calculate corresponding fractions. There numerator is the dot product, while denominator -
     * multiplied those two vector norms.
     *
     * ### Threading model ###
     *
     * The implementation of this class is thread-safe, i.e., its
     * consume() member function can be called concurrently and from multiple
     * threads.
     *
     *
     * @tparam InputType The C++ type used for the samples $x_k$. In
     *   order to compute covariances, the same kind of requirements
     *   have to hold as listed for the MeanValue class.
