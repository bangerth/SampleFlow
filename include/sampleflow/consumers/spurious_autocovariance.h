     * NOTICE: We can only say, that this algorithm calculates "spurious autocovariance", because by definition
     * autocovariance function is much more complex it is not (except if we work samples of one dimension). Anyway, later in this code we use word autocovariance as
     * we refer to spurious autocovariance.
     *
     * This is a Consumer class that implements computing the running sample autocovariance function:
     * $\hat\gamma(l)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{(\bm{x}_{t+l}-\bar\bm{x})(bm{x}_{t}-\bar\bm{x})}$
     *
     * This code for every new sample updates $\hat\gamma(k), l=1,2,3...,k$. The value of $n$ is set
     * in the constructor.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * There are three parts: 1) When amount of samples (sample_n) is equal 0 2) When k>sample_n 3) Otherwise
     * Second and third parts are almost identical, just for "l" bigger than sample_n it is not possible to
     * get \gamma(l) estimation. Further description focus on part 3) (case with big enough sample_n)
     *
     * Let expand formula above and then denote some of its parts as $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
     * \hat\gamma(l)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{(\bm{x}_{t+l}-\bar\bm{x_n})^T(bm{x}_{t}-\bar\bm{x_n})}=
     * =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{(\bm{x}_{t+l})^T(bm{x}_{t})}-
     * -(\bar\bm{x_n}^T)\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{\bm{x}_{t+l}+(bm{x}_{t}}+
     * +\frac{n-l}{n}(\bar\bm{x_n}^T)(\bar\bm{x_n})=
     * =\alpha_n(l)-(\bar\bm{x_n}^T)\bm{beta_n(l)}+\frac{n-l}{n}(\bar\bm{x_n}^T)(\bar\bm{x_n}).$
     *
     * During calculation, we need to update $\alpha_{n+1}(l) (scalar),
     * \bm{beta_{n+1}(l)}$ (same dimension as sample) and sample mean $\bar\bm{x_{n+1}$
     *
     * Notice, that for each l, $\alpha_{n}(l)$ and $\bm{beta_{n}(l)}$ is different. So to save $\alpha$ values
     * we need to have vector, while for $\bm{\beta}$ - matrix.
     *
     * Principle of this updating algorithm is equivalent as in mean_value.h
     *
     * ### Threading model ###
     *
     * The implementation of this class is thread-safe, i.e., its
     * consume() member function can be called concurrently and from multiple
     * threads.
     *
     *
     * @tparam InputType The C++ type used for the samples $x_k$. In
     *   order to compute auto covariances, the same kind of requirements
     *   have to hold as listed for the Covariance class (we need to be able to
     *   calculate mean, divide by positive integer ant etc)
