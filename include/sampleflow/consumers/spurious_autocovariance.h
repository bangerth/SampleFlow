     * @note This class only calculates a "spurious autocovariance" since the actual
     *   definition of "autocovariance" is more complex than what we do here (except
     *   if we work scalar samples types). That said, below we will use the word
     *   "autocovariance" even when refering to this spurious autocovariance.
     *
     * This is a Consumer class that implements computing the running sample autocovariance function:
     * @f{align*}{
     *   \hat\gamma(l)
     *   =
     *   \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{(x_{t+l}-\bar{x})(x_{t}-\bar{x})}.
     * @f}
     * In other words, it calculates the covariance of samples $x_{t+l}$ and $x_t$
     * with a lag between zero and $k$
     *
     * This class updates $\hat\gamma(l), l=0,1,2,3,\ldots,k$ for each new, incoming
     * sample. The value of $k$ is set in the constructor.
     *
     *
     * <h3> Algorithm </h3>
     *
     * In the following, let us only consider the case when we have already seen
     * $n\ge k$ samples, so that all of the $\hat\gamma(l)$ can actually be computed.
     *
     * Let us expand formula above and then denote some of its parts as $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
     * @f{align*}{
     *   \hat\gamma(l)
     *   &=
     *   \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{(x_{t+l}-\bar{x}_n)^T(x_{t}-\bar{x}_n)}
     * \\&=
     *   \underbrace{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}{x_{t+l}^T x_{t}}}_{\alpha_n(l)}
     *   -
     *   \bar{x}_n^T
     *   \underbrace{\left[ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n-l}(x_{t+l}+x_{t}) \right]}_{\beta_n(l)}
     *   +
     *   \frac{n-l}{n}\bar{x}_n^T \bar{x}_n
     * \\&=
     *   \alpha_n(l)-\bar{x}_n^T \beta_n(l)+\frac{n-l}{n} \bar{x}_n^T \bar{x}_n.
     * @f}
     *
     * For each new sample, we then need to update the scalars $\alpha_{n+1}(l)$,
     * vectors $\beta_{n+1}(l)$, and sample mean $\bar{x}_{n+1}$. The
     * principle of this updating algorithm is equivalent to what the MeanValue
     * class does.
     *
     *
     * ### Threading model ###
     *
     * The implementation of this class is thread-safe, i.e., its
     * consume() member function can be called concurrently and from multiple
     * threads.
     *
     *
     * @tparam InputType The C++ type used for the samples $x_k$. In
     *   order to compute auto covariances, the same kind of requirements
     *   have to hold as listed for the Covariance class (we need to be able to
     *   calculate mean, divide by positive integer ant etc)
